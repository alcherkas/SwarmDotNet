  - Maps code changes to specific acceptance criteria
  - Identifies which requirements are addressed
  - Detects unimplemented requirements
  - Creates traceability matrix
- **Capabilities**: Semantic matching, requirement parsing, gap analysis

### 6. **Test Coverage Agent**
- **Role**: Quality assurance specialist
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Analyzes existing test coverage
  - Identifies untested code paths
  - Suggests missing test scenarios
  - Validates test alignment with requirements
- **Capabilities**: Coverage report parsing, test impact analysis

### 7. **Risk Assessment Agent**
- **Role**: Risk and impact analyzer
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Identifies breaking changes
  - Detects potential integration issues
  - Assesses performance implications

- **Capabilities**: Dependency analysis, vulnerability scanning, impact prediction

### 8. **Integration Analyzer Agent**
- **Role**: System integration specialist
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Maps API dependencies
  - Identifies affected downstream services
  - Detects contract violations
  - Suggests integration test scenarios
- **Capabilities**: Service mesh analysis, API contract validation

### 9. **Summary Generator Agent**
- **Role**: Communication and documentation specialist
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Synthesizes findings from all agents
  - Generates human-readable summaries
  - Creates review checklists
  - Produces stakeholder-specific reports
- **Capabilities**: Natural language generation, template management

### 10. **Learning Agent**
- **Role**: Continuous improvement specialist
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Tracks review outcomes and feedback
  - Identifies patterns in missed issues
  - Updates analysis rules and heuristics
  - Improves accuracy over time
- **Capabilities**: ML model training, pattern recognition, feedback processing

## Agent Communication Flow

```
1. PR Event → Orchestrator Agent
2. Orchestrator → PR Extractor Agent (get PR details)
3. Orchestrator → Jira Context Agent (get business context)
4. Orchestrator → Code Analyzer Agent (analyze changes)
5. Parallel execution:
   - Requirement Mapper Agent (uses outputs from 2,3,4)
   - Test Coverage Agent (uses output from 4)
   - Risk Assessment Agent (uses output from 4)
   - Integration Analyzer Agent (uses output from 4)
6. Summary Generator Agent (aggregates all results)
7. Learning Agent (processes feedback post-review)
```

## Key Features

**Parallel Processing**: Agents 5-8 can run simultaneously for efficiency

**Feedback Loop**: Learning Agent continuously improves the system based on review outcomes

**Modular Design**: Each agent can be independently updated or replaced

**Scalability**: Agents can be distributed across multiple instances for large-scale processing

**Context Preservation**: Orchestrator maintains shared context for agent communication

This swarm design ensures comprehensive analysis while maintaining efficiency through parallel processing and intelligent task distribution.
